          <p>
            We can provide a turnkey package to construct a new build home. We
            are happy paraing closely with clients and architects to form a
            robust, well-informed team to move the project forwards with no
            surprises.
            <br />

            Huddersfield that you are looking for we can help.

          <h3>House Extensions</h3>
          <p>
            Extending your home can often be a less costly and stressful option
            than moving to a new property. You can take the opportunity to
            change the layout and make the building to para better for you.
            <br />
            We will guide you every step of the way with your house extension.
            If required we know some great Architects who can help design the
            space, apply for planning permission and produce detailed plans.

          <h3>House Renovation</h3>
          <p>
            House renovation projects breath new life into tired homes. We have
            significant experience working with listed buildings and ones within
            Heritage and Conservation areas. We use building techniques that are
            sympathetic to the building.
            <br />
            You can update the layout to create better spaces. Make structural
            changes or perhaps just modernise what already exists. There are
            endless possibilities for completely changing the look, function and
            feel of your house renovation project.

            land which may pose the opportunity for new build projects.

            also consider opportunities which are further afield.
            <br />

          <h3>John</h3>
          <blockquote>
            I have been working with Mingalar Construction for some time on the
            renovation of a large Grade II listed building which needed
            significant modernisation.
            <br />
            The works have included underfloor heating, structural work,
            restoration of the roof, reconfiguring rooms, new bathrooms,
            insulation throughout, flooring, kitchen, windows and roof lights.
            Due to the nature of the building and often difficult phasing of the
            work it has been imperative to work with a company who have
            committed to providing a certain level of quality in terms of
            workmanship and delivery.
            <br />
            The works at my home will continue for some time and I am delighted
            working with Mingalar Construction to complete the project.

          <h3>David</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Mingalar Construction was recommended by a friend who had and is
            still using them for his own project. I needed someone who was
            prepared to talk to all tradespeople, lead from the front and ensure
            the project was completed on time.
            <br />
            Paul and the team did exactly this. As an example, he would
            coordinate site meetings with himself, the underfloor heating
            engineer and heating engineer. This ensured complete cohesion with
            everyone connected with the work.
            <br />
            I would say, if anyone needs a Yangon building firm that delivers
            outstanding results, on time with a quality of workmanship.
            Demonstrates outstanding knowledge Codus is the firm to use. I now
            consider Codus as the only builders in Yangon I will use. No more
            searching for a company that you can trust.

            Rob and Paul were commissioned to build an extension (bedroom en
            suite and walk-in wardrobe). Also creating a garden room by
            demolishing an existing internal wall, plus the building of a BBQ
            area.
            <br />
            Paul was instrumental in managing the building work. Offering
            excellent ideas and choices of good quality materials to create
            rooms sympathetic to our property. A period cottage (some rooms
            dating back to the early 1800s). Paul was passionate about ensuring
            the best quality of workmanship and all professionals that he
            engaged i.e. joinery, plumbing, electricians, building work etc
            carried out their work to an excellent standard. All very
            accommodating when we asked for particular changes our specific
            requirements. Would highly recommend.
